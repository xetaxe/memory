# Memory app (Basic React project)

Created with  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Its purpose was the understand all the intricacies of React Hooks, rerenders and best practices.

## Reference material

I consider these articles/resources to be so illustrating for beginners that I decided to put them at the top of the README. All their content should be read thoroughly by anyone trying to understand how React works:

- [React re-renders guide: everything, all at once](https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-re-renders-guide)
- [How to write performant React code: rules, patterns, do's and don'ts](https://www.developerway.com/posts/how-to-write-performant-react-code)
- [Beta React docs (Learn)](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)
